Hello, everyone! 

I've been taking a (short) break from working on Cloud Miners and made a game demo with a friend for Ludum Dare 46! I made a majority of the art, and all the music for the game, as well as some programming and game design. The game demo can be played at [Lost Generation's Itch Page](https://lostgenerationgames.itch.io/darkstar)

I'd love to hear any feedback or comments you have! It was lots of fun to take part in the game jam, and Arity and I will continue working on this project and create a full game out of it, so stay tuned for more!
