Howdy!

I know it's been a good minute since any updates, but I'm happy to finally share what I've been working on with Jabari Alli and Adrian Marple over the last year! Tetra Tactics has been released on Steam, and you can [wishlist it](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1937110/Tetra_Tactics/) now! Tetra Tactics is a roguelike deckbuilder inspired by the Final Fantasy VIII minigame Triple Triad. You traverse 3 maps fighting increasingly difficult enemies as you improve your deck comprised of 8 cards. If you like roguelike deckbuilders like Slay the Spire, Inscryption, and Balatro, check out Tetra Tactics!
