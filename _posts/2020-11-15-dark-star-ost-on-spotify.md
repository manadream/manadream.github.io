Hey, all!

I've released the Dark Star Demo OST to Spotify, iTunes, Amazon, ect. so you can listen to it however you like! I've been getting great responses for this release and hope you enjoy it as well. Check it out [here](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/manadream/dark-star-demo-original-video-game-soundtrack)

In other news, I'm continuing to work on Cloud Miners, and have updated the logo and titlescreen, which you can see on the [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244410).

I'm also working on another game for the BAD Collective's Fall Jam. I'll be posting updates on that soon.

Thanks again for all the support! Hope you're all well!
