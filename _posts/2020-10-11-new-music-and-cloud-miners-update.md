Howdy! 

I was hard at work on Cloud Miners over the last few months getting it ready for MagWest festival, which went great! You can see [Cloud Miners' festival page](https://www.magwest.org/2020-indie-games/2020/9/21/cloud-miners) for more info.

And now that the festival is over, I took a little break from game dev to work on some music and animation. I hope you enjoy this song and accompanying animation loop!

The full song is [here](https://manadream.bandcamp.com)

As for Cloud Miners, I've been making a lot of progress and will soon be in need of beta testers, so keep an eye out for that. In the meantime, check out the [updated Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244410/Cloud_Miners/) with fresh screenshots of some of the new content in the game.

Happy Gaming,
