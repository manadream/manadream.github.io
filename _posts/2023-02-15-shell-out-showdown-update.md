Shell Out Showdown is in Friendship Games Week 2023 on Steam + Massive Content Update!

Hello, food tossing friends!

It's been a good while since there's been an update, and that's because I've been working on getting everything ready for this huge update, available now!

There's so much in this update, we've got a new character, a new map, a bunch of single player modes like Balloon Burst, Survival Mode and Elimination Challenge, plus a whole heckin' Story Mode. In addition, there are New Accessories to get, and tons of fixes, tweaks and improvements. I'm really excited for you all to check out the new content, I really hope you enjoy it.

In addition, Shell Out Showdown is in the Friendship Games Week Festival on Steam! Definitely check out the fest, which started this Monday, the 13th of February, and goes until the 19th.
