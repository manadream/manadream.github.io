Hey, y'all!

I know it's been a good minute since any updates, but I'm happy to finally share what I've been working on over the past 6 months! Shell Out Showdown is coming soon to Steam and Itch.io, and you can [wishlist it on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1556660/Shell_Out_Showdown/) now! It's a 2D Battle Royale Platformer Food Fight made for the Bay Area Developers (B.A.D.) Collective's Molasses Jam, which has "turn a violent genre non-violent" as the theme. There will be 3 other games made by local devs released as a part of this longer length game jam, and we'll be releasing all the games from the jam as a pack on Itch, so keep an eye out for updates on that as well.

Shell Out Showdown will also be a part of the Steam's Summer Festival, [Next Fest](https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/summer-games-festival-2021-coming-in-june/za2dc1), from June 16th through 22nd, and you'll be able to download the game demo during this time. I'm super excited to play this game with you all and hope that you'll be able to join us during the festival.

On another note, I'm getting back into working on [Cloud Miners](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1244410/Cloud_Miners/) and will be posting updates on that as development progresses. I've uploaded the Teaser Trailer from MAG West 2020 to YouTube and Steam, so check that out to see where it's currently at in development!

Thank you all so much for the support, I greatly appreciate it. I'm thrilled to finally be releasing a full game and I thank you for encouraging me to continue doing what I love.
