Whoa, a new game!

I've been cooking up a new silly twist on game mechanics and have made a game all about scratchcards! It's [available for wishlisting on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3622600/Scratchcard_Hero/) now! Get to scratchin' in this realtime rogueli*e deckbuilder where all your cards are lottery scratch off tickets! Make your build of scratchcards and gadgets, and 1v1 battle other scratcher enthusiasts on your way to the source of your town's gambling problems.
