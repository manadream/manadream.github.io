description: New jams for you to listen to!

Hello, Friends!

I have added a few tracks to the [Dark Star (Demo) Soundtrack](https://manadream.bandcamp.com/album/dark-star-demo-original-soundtrack)! I'll be adding tracks as development progresses for Dark Star, and those will all be included for free to anyone who has the album. Stay tuned for more updates and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manadream_) and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/manadream.exe) to stay up to date on all my projects! 

Thanks again for all your support, it allows me to continue working as an artist and share my work with everyone. I really appreciate it <3

-Mana
