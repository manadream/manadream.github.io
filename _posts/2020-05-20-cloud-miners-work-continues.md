Hello, everyone! I know it's been pretty quiet here lately, so I wanted to give y'all an update. 

I'm still working on Cloud Miners, above is an image from the intro story sequence I completed recently. My plan is to continue working on the content for the game and try to get an alpha build out in the third or fourth quarter of this year. I don't want to rush the game, as I feel it deserves attention to detail and rushing it would not do the game justice. So I'll keep y'all updated on its progress.

In addition to working on Cloud Miners, I'm also working on a game with my friend Arity, called Dark Star. It is a throwback to classic shmups, with modern elements and new twists on the genre. We are working hard to get this game out as soon as possible and hope that y'all will be able to play the full game soon. The demo is already [available here](https://lostgenerationgames.itch.io/darkstar), which we will continue to update with some of the new content.

That said, I really appreciate all of your support and will continue to post updates on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/manadream) as well as [Instagram](https://instagram.com/manadream.exe) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/manadream_).

Until next time,
